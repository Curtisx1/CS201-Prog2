Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We s
pent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) 
and will remember this time as ours best.
The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around t
he corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jenn
ifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly
 recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in
 the center of the boiling Midtown!"
We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming apartment! They were very organiz
ed and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!
